            This project aims to demonstrate the the steps of observing and understanding users through 
            the creation of personas and a storyboard for an accessible public interface.

            <h3>Part 1: Preparation</h3>

            <h4>1. Selecting an Accessible Interface</h4>
        
            <p>&emsp; 
                I chose to do the accessible interface that is the gas 
                pump, which is in the public eye. More specifically, a Shell gas pump.
            </p>
        
            <h4>2. Annotated Sketch and Brief Description of Interface </h4>
        
            <p>&emsp; 
                The gas pump interface serves the purpose of letting people pay and fill up their
                gas without having to enter the store if paying with card. It lets the user choose
                how much gas and what kind of gas they'd like to fill up their car with. The gas pump 
                solves the problem in many cases of needing a gas station attendant assist you with 
                filling up the gas tank. In other words, a middleman is unnecessary to add gas to 
                your vehicle.

            <h3>Part 2: Recording Observations</h3>

            <h4>1. Key Observations from Users</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The typical user would pull up to the gas pump, get out of their car, and 
                    before even truly interacting with the interface would pull out a card to pay. 
                    They'd then press a one or two buttons and then take out the fuel nozzle and 
                    insert it into the car.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some users adjusted/clicked the nozzle to stay in the car without standing next
                    to the nozzle as their car filled up with gas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users did not seem confused or held up by the interface, as the time between 
                    arriving in front of the interface to inserting the nozzle was very short.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a user did not get back into their car as the gas filled, they would be 
                    looking at the price display increase in number.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes users would appear to click the same button on the screen a couple of 
                    times, buttons could've been broken. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Numbered Question List and Interview Observations</h4>
            <h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        How often do you go to the gas station?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do you usually pay with cash or card?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Are you a gas rewards user? If so, how does it change your experience at the pump?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do you think you could briefly explain how to use a gas pump to someone who has 
                        never used or seen one?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do you find navigating a gas pump straighforward? What's the most difficult piece to
                        navigate?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If there was one step you could eliminate from the process of filling up your tank
                        at the pump, what would you eliminate and why? What you you replace/change it with?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have you ever had a particularly memorable experience interacting with the interface 
                        of a gas pump?
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most interveiwees were regulars, going to the gas station once every 1/2 weeks consistently
                </li>
                <li>
                    There wasn't an interviewee who couldn't describe the steps of pumping gas in moderate detail,
                    even those who hadn't pumped gas for a little bit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A lot of the interface difficulties came not from the screen or buttons but rather the nozzle. 
                    Several users noted that on the first time using the nozzle they didn't know how to operate it
                    as there were no instructions and no enough intuition as a new user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Those who did occasionally use gas found it inconvienient that they had to go inside the store
                    and see an attendant to pay cash, would've rather had it at the pump.
                </li>
            </ul>
